## üìò Problem Description

While working on the Enigma code, Alan Turing faced a logical challenge:
Given a rectangular machine with **M rows** and **N columns**, each cell contains a box that can only be opened with a specific **key type** (there are **k** key types in total).
The goal is to determine whether it is possible to open all boxes (i.e., decode the hidden message) **without breaking the machine**, using a sequence of operations that each apply one key to a rectangular subregion.

Rules:

* Each operation applies one key type to a **rectangular submatrix**.
* Boxes that don‚Äôt match the key type remain closed.
* If a key is applied to a box that is already open, the machine breaks and the message is lost.
* Each key can be used **exactly once**.

The task is to decide if there exists a valid sequence of key applications, and if so, output the correct order and rectangular ranges for each key.

## üí° Solution Overview

The algorithm proceeds in **three main stages**:

1. **Submatrix detection per key**
   Each unique key type is analyzed to determine the **smallest bounding rectangle** that includes all of its occurrences in the matrix.

2. **Dependency graph construction**
   If one key‚Äôs rectangle fully contains another key‚Äôs area, a **dependency** is formed ‚Äî meaning one key must be applied before the other.

3. **Topological sorting**
   Using **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm**, the dependency graph is checked:

   * If the graph contains a cycle ‚Üí there is no valid order ‚Üí output `NO SE PUEDE`.
   * Otherwise, the topological order provides the valid **sequence of key usages**.

### Core Functions

| Method                           | Description                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main()`                         | Reads all test cases from standard input and calls `solve()` for each case.                                       |
| `solve()`                        | Coordinates the main process: identifies submatrices, builds the dependency graph, and runs the topological sort. |
| `encontrarEsquinasSubmatrices()` | Finds the top-left and bottom-right corners for each key‚Äôs submatrix.                                             |
| `obtenerValoresEncerrados()`     | Builds the dependency graph by detecting which key areas are enclosed by others.                                  |
| `ordenamientoTopologico()`       | Implements **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm** for topological sorting and cycle detection.                                      |

## üßÆ Complexity Analysis

| Type                 | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time Complexity**  | O(M √ó N + K + E), where *E* is the number of dependency edges (worst case O(M√óN)). |
| **Space Complexity** | O(M √ó N + K¬≤) due to the matrix and adjacency structures.                          |

The approach efficiently handles the given constraints:
2 ‚â§ M, N ‚â§ 1000 and 1 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 10‚Åµ.

## üß† Additional Scenarios

| Scenario                        | Implication                                                            | Required Adjustment                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. A key can be used twice.** | The dependency graph may include multiple edges between the same keys. | Modify the topological algorithm to allow repeated operations.         |
| **2. L-shaped structures.**     | The bounding-box approach is insufficient for non-rectangular shapes.  | Represent key regions explicitly (e.g., as coordinate lists or masks). |
